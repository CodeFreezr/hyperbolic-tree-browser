# Hyperbolic Tree Browser with D3.js

A hyperbolic tree implementation using D3.js.

The mathematical base and implementation is based upon the work of Benjamin
BergÃ© and Christophe Bouthier, see "Mathematics and Algorithms for the
Hyperbolic Tree Visualization".

The library hyperbolic\_math.js is based on the work of John Lamping and Ramana
Rao, see "The Hyperbolic Browser : A Focus 1 Context Technique for Visualizing
Large Hierarchies".

## Usage

You can run the demo application by using [npm] or [yarn], installing the
javascript dependencies with `yarn install` and starting the demo application
with `yarn server`. Your default web browser will open the at
[http://localhost:3000]. Any changes to source files (scss/css, html,
javascript) will update the browser window automatically.

To use the hierarchy visualisation with your own data, see demo application
index file at [/src/app.js].

```javascript
(new HierarchyData('json')) // initialize importer of type json
  .fetch('/assets/data/simple.json') // fetch remote source from /public/assets/data/simple.json
  .then(data => treemap(d3.hierarchy(data))) // prepare data
  .then(root => {
    const tree = new HyperTree(root); // initialize hyperbolic transformation
    tree.build(); // calculation hyperbolic space transformations
    tree.view.draw(); // calculate presentation space transformations
    new RadialTreeBrowser('svg').draw(root); // draw data in d3 visualisation
  });
```

See [/src/utils/hierarchy\_data.json] to find usage information for the file
import.

## Setup and Development

The ES6 javascript source code located in [/src/] directory is transformed and
merged into browser friendly JavaScript using **webpack** and **babel**
resulting in the [/public/assets/bunlde.js] ready to be used by the demo
application.
Changes to any source files are watched and the demo application automatically
refresehd in any open browser window using **browser-sync**.
A **jest** JavaScript testing based on Jasmin is used to ensure
hypertree calculation produce expected results.
To ensure quick edit of styles a **node-sass** watcher is
transforming SCSS code into CSS inside [/public/assets/] path.

Note: After build process there is no other dependency than **D3 (version
4.9.1)**, any of the before mentioned libraries are used in development
environment only.

```shell
$ yarn install         # install javascript stuff
$ yarn build           # build project files
$ yarn server          # start development server
$ yarn watch           # watch source changes
$ yarn watch-styles    # watch style changes
$ yarn test            # run tests
$ yarn test -- --watch # watch tests
```
